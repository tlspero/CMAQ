********************************************************************************
Announcing the release of MCIP Version 4.4 (20 June 2017)
********************************************************************************

The MCIP code is updated to version 4.4.  These release notes and the change
log reflect all changes that have been made to MCIP since MCIPv4.3 (the last
official release).  Changes to MCIPv4.4 were made by Tanya Spero (U.S. EPA).
User contributions are also noted below.  The detailed list of changes to the
MCIP code is in the CHANGES file, which is part of the MCIP tar file in the
"doc" sub-directory.

MCIPv4.4 requires I/O API version 3.1 or greater to support error-checking
within the I/O API.  Note that CMAQv5.2 requires I/O API v3.2.

MCIPv4.4 requires the netCDF F90 module (rather than the F77 include).

Users are encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file,
which is located in the MCIP tar file in the "doc" sub-directory.

***Users should consult the FAQ before submitting inquiries to M3User,
   CMAS, or the code developers.***

MCIPv4.4 has been tested with the following Fortran compilers under both debug
and optimized options:  Intel 17.0.  MCIPv4.4 has been tested with netCDF 4.4.1
and I/O API 3.2.


Interactions with members of the CMAQ user community led to some of the changes
that have been incorporated into MCIPv4.4.


The following is a summary of the changes in MCIPv4.4:

 1.  Changed name of the run script to "run_mcip.csh" and changed the names of
     MCIP files referenced in the script to have the extension ".nc" to be
     consistent with other changes in the CMAQ system.

 2.  Made minor changes to WRF implementation of MODIS land use with category
     21 representing "lake".

 3.  Corrected error in the calculation of 10-m wind speed from WRF simulations.

 4.  Refined coding in some places to increase robustness under different
     Fortran compilers.

 5.  Changed reference to WRF variable for fraction of urban area to be
     consistent with its usage in WRF.

 6.  Updated metadata for new physics options in WRFv3.8, WRFv3.8.1, and
     WRFv3.9.

 7.  Determine whether or not the hybrid vertical coordinate was used in WRF;
     it is available as of WRFv3.9.  Currently prevent data with hybrid
     coordinate from being used in MCIP and CMAQ until additional modifications
     and testing are performed.

 8.  The following output variables in METCRO2D remain deprecated:
     - 2-D cloud fraction (CFRAC)
     - cloud top (CLDT)
     - cloud bottom (CLDB)
     - liquid water content (WBAR)
     They will be removed from METCRO2D in a forthcoming release of MCIP.
